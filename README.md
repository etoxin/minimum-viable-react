# Minimum Viable React

Minimum Viable React is a boilerplate for React Hooks applications with Global State and Reducers. No need for Redux.

Working Demo: [https://minimum-viable-react.vercel.app](https://minimum-viable-react.vercel.app)

### Folder structure

- `components` React functional components. No logic in these components.
- `hooks` Custom React Hooks. All logic in here.
- `reducers` React reducers. State manipulations.
- `routes` react-router page routes. All pages here and add route to: `./app.tsx`

### Todo:

- state `localstorage` sync
